# CudaSnek - GPU-Accelerated Snake AI

A self-playing Snake game that uses deep reinforcement learning with TensorFlow.js to train an AI that gets smarter over time. Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, particularly the RTX 3060 Ti.

## Features

- Deep reinforcement learning with neural networks
- GPU acceleration using WebGL and TensorFlow.js
- Multiple AI modes: Basic, Advanced, Q-Learning, and Deep Learning
- Real-time training visualization
- Turbo training mode for maximum GPU utilization
- Model export/import for sharing trained models
- GPU performance monitoring
- Interactive tooltips and animated instructions
- Dummy-proof interface with visual cues

## How to Use

1. Select an AI mode (Deep Learning for GPU acceleration)
2. Watch the AI play and learn
3. Train the model using the "Train on GPU" button
4. Save or export your trained model

## Technologies

- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
